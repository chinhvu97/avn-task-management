### Slide 4: Solution Overview
Present the comprehensive Task & Shift Management platform with three core modules:

**Module 1: Task Management**  
Three flexible views for managing daily operations:
- **Timeline View**: Visual schedule showing time-based task allocation per staff
- **Kanban View**: Column-based board (Open → Processing → Pending → Awaiting Approval → Done → Cancelled)
- **List View**: Tabular view with sortable columns for detailed analysis

**Module 2: Shift Management**  
Attendance and performance tracking:
- **Attendance Tracking**: Monitor check-in/check-out times, attendance patterns
- **Performance View**: Track task assignment percentage, workload distribution
- **Week & Month Views**: Flexible time period analysis

**Module 3: Leaderboard**  
Performance rankings and gamification:
- **Multi-level Rankings**: Store, Regional, and Global leaderboards
- **Key Metrics**: Tasks completed, completion rate, total hours, efficiency score
- **Rewards System**: Tiered rewards based on performance levels
- **Calendar Heatmap**: Visual representation of performance trends

### Slide 5: Key Features - Task Types

**DWS Tasks (Daily Work Standard)**
- Standardized daily routine tasks
- Guide references with links to operational standards (e.g., "1.2.a", "2.1.c")
- Consistent execution across all shifts
- Examples: Floor cleaning, produce arrangement, customer service counter

**WS Tasks (Work Standard - Event-based)**
- Occasional/special event tasks
- Sample images for visual guidance
- Photo upload for completion verification
- AI verification capability
- HQ approval workflow for quality control
- Examples: Women's Day displays, Lunar New Year decorations, Black Friday promotions

### Slide 6: Key Features - Task Workflow
Illustrate the complete task lifecycle:
1. **Open**: Task assigned to staff
2. **Processing**: Staff actively working on task
3. **Pending**: Task on hold, awaiting action
4. **Awaiting Approval**: Completion submitted, pending verification
5. **Done**: Task completed and approved
6. **Cancelled**: Task cancelled with reason tracking

Show how task status transitions work and the approval workflow for WS tasks.

### Slide 7: Multi-level Organization Support
**Three organizational levels:**
- **Store Level**: Individual retail locations (e.g., Ocean Park Hawaii Building)
- **Regional Level**: Multiple stores within a city (e.g., Ocean Park region with Tower A, Tower B, Central Building)
